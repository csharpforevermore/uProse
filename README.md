A proof of concept that uses Umbraco to allow users to write their own books. There are a variety of tools and widgets, that provide tools for enhancing the writer's productivity.  This includes mind-maps, annotations, profile templates (for story elements such as characters, places, etc), tips, guide to getting published, publish to Amazon Kindle, copyright manager, license manager, publisher CRM, and many more tools. This is a work-in-progress and subject to many revisions of both the code, and the concepts outlined in this description. Therefore, it is the intent of the developer to maintain documentation regarding such features, but this description as well as such documentation, should not be considered comprehensive.  All rights are reserved, however I will generally provide authorisation for anyone to use this software - on the condition that I get some sort of an acknowledgement since I am creating this application to improve my development skills as well as make a name for myself. Therefore, I appreciate recognition of my work such that it may help me enhance my career and obtain work.
